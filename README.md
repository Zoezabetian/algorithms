# C/C++ data structures and algorithms projects

This repository contains several algorithms implementations in C and C++. The projects demonstrate key concepts in data structures, algorithms, and advanced computation, including list ADTs, graph traversal, binary search trees (BST), and red-black trees. Below is a list of the projects included.

## C Projects

### 1. List Data Structure
   - **Description**: This project implements a List ADT in C, which includes operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. The list is designed to efficiently manage a collection of elements, providing functionalities such as adding and removing items from both ends, as well as retrieving elements by index.
   - **Key Operations**:
     - Insert
     - Delete
     - Traversal
     - Search

### 2. Graph Data Type: BFS (Breadth-First Search)
   - **Description**: This project implements a Graph ADT in C with BFS (Breadth-First Search) to explore all the vertices of the graph starting from a source node. BFS is used to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs and is essential in network analysis and search algorithms.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Graph Representation using adjacency lists
     - BFS Traversal
     - Pathfinding and distance calculations

### 3. Graph Data Type: DFS (Depth-First Search)
   - **Description**: This project implements a Graph ADT with DFS (Depth-First Search) for exploring nodes in a graph. DFS is used in tasks such as topological sorting, cycle detection, and strongly connected components.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Graph Representation using adjacency lists
     - DFS Traversal
     - Cycle Detection and Topological Sorting

### 4. Matrix Data Type
   - **Description**: This project implements a Matrix ADT in C for managing matrices. Operations include matrix multiplication, transposition, and inversion, which are essential in linear algebra and numerical methods.
   - **Key Operations**:
     - Matrix Addition
     - Matrix Multiplication
     - Matrix Transposition
     - Matrix Inversion

## C++ Projects

### 1. List Data Structure
   - **Description**: This project implements a List ADT in C++ using **dynamic arrays** and **linked lists**. It includes operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal, supporting both **array-based** and **pointer-based** list implementations.
   - **Key Operations**:
     - Insert
     - Delete
     - Traversal
     - Search

### 2. Large Integer Calculator
   - **Description**: This project implements a calculator for **large integers** using custom data structures. The calculator handles large integer arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) beyond standard primitive types.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Arbitrary precision arithmetic
     - Operations for large integer handling
     - Efficient memory management

### 3. Binary Search Tree 
   - **Description**: This project implements a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in C++ with efficient operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and traversal. The BST maintains ordered data for fast lookups and is widely used in applications like databases and file systems.
   - **Key Operations**:
     - Insertion
     - Deletion
     - Search
     - Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder Traversal

### 4. Red-Black Tree
   - **Description**: This project implements a **Red-Black Tree** in C++, a type of self-balancing binary search tree. It ensures that the tree remains balanced after every insertion and deletion, which guarantees logarithmic time complexity for search operations.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Red-Black Tree Properties (balance and coloring rules)
     - Insertion and Deletion with balancing
     - Search and traversal operations
