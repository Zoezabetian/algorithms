# List Data Structure in C++
## Description

This project involves the creation of a List ADT in C++ to perform shuffling operations on a deck of cards, simulating perfect shuffles to determine the number of shuffles needed to return the deck to its original order. The project showcases the application of doubly linked lists, operator overloading, and ADT design patterns in C++.


## Files Included

- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.
- `Makefile`: Commands to compile the project.
- `List.h`: Header file for the List ADT (unchanged as provided).
- `List.cpp`: Implementation of the List ADT, consisting of constructors & destructors, access functions, manipulation procedures, overridden operators, and more.
- `ListTest.cpp`: Rigorous testing to confirm List ADT functionality.
- `Shuffle.cpp`: Main program that uses the List ADT for shuffling operations.
