# DFS Algorithm in C

## Description

This C program constructs and utilizes a Graph Abstract Data Type (ADT) to represent graphs, print adjacency lists, and find strongly connected components of a digraph using the newly implemented Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. 

## Files Included

- `List.h`: Header file with declarations for the List ADT.
- `List.c`: Source file that implements the List ADT functions declared in `List.h`.
- `Graph.h`: Header file with declarations for the Graph ADT.
- `Graph.c`: Source file that implements the Graph ADT functions declared in `Graph.h`, such as the search algorithms BFS() and DFS().
- `getSCCs.c`: Main application file that uses the Graph ADT for generating adjacency lists and finding strongly connected components of directed graphs.
- `GraphTest.c`: Test suite for validating the functionality of the Graph ADT.
- `Makefile`: A makefile with instructions for compiling the project.
