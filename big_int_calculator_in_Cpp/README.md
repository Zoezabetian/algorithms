# Large Number Calculator

## Description
This assignment involves creating a LargeInt Abstract Data Type (ADT) in C++, designed to handle operations operations on large signed integers. This ADT utilizes a List of long integers to represent the magnitude of the LargeInt, with each list element acting as a base-10 digit. The LargeInt also stores a sign value. 


## Files Included

- `operations.cpp`: Top level client for the project.
- `LargeInt.cpp`: LargeInt implementation file.
- `LargeInt.h`: LargeInt header file .
- `LargeIntTest.cpp`: Test suite for the LargeInt ADT.
- `List.cpp`: List implementation file.
- `List.h`: List header file
- `Makefile`: Commands to compile the project.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.


## Build and Run Instructions

**To Build:**  
Run `make` in the terminal to compile the project.

**To Run:**  
Execute `./operations <input file> <output file>`
