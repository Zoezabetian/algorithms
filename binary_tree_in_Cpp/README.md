# Binary Search Tree Algorithm in C++


## Description
This project introduces a Dictionary ADT built on a Binary Search Tree in C++, focusing on unique key management with duplicate values allowed. The main program, mapping.cpp, demonstrates the ADT's practical use by mapping.cpp input file lines to dictionary keys for efficient data retrieval. It features essential operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal, with output showcasing key-value pairs and a pre-order tree walk of keys.
